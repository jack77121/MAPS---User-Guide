The red LED will shine for a while, and then the green LED will keep lighting after MAPS becomes ready.

## step 2.

**Find the WiFi AP with the prefix “**_**LinkIt\_Smart\_7688**_**\_” in your WiFi configuration, and connect to this WiFi AP. **

**Then, the red LED of your MAPS will start blinking, meaning you are doing right so far.**

For example, please join the WiFi network "LinkIt\_Smart\_7688\_1B2642" in the above example.

## step 3.

**Open your browser and go to **[**http://mapsOXOX.local/cgi-bin/luci**](http://mapsoxox.local/cgi-bin/luci)** **

**Note that “OXOX” is the device number \(four digits\) of your MAPS box, and you can find it easily on the top of your MAPS device.**

For example, the device number of the above MAPS device is 0020, and you have to go to [http://maps0020.local/cgi-bin/luci ](http://maps0020.local/cgi-bin/luci)for the following steps.

## step 4.

**Please input the default password **_**iisnrl619**_** on the login page.**

## step 5.

**If you have no ideas about the GPS coordinates, please see FAQ.**

Note that, the default GPS coordinates are on the Senkaku Islands, which means your measurement data will be placed there on the map unless you correctly setup the GPS coordinates.

## step 6.

**Now, the last step is to set up the WiFi of your MAPS device. **

**Please click \`System' and then \`MAPS configuration' for configuration.**

**Please input your WiFi SSID and PASSWORD information accordingly, and then click 'Yes, please'.**

## step 7.

**Your MAPS will reboot after step 6.**

**Please wait about 3 minutes, and the system will start working then.    
**

## step 8.

**Now, please go to the webpage **[**https://data.lass-net.org/grafana/**](https://data.lass-net.org/grafana/)

**Please click the device ID panel on the top left corner of the page, and input your device ID \(i.e., MAPS-OXOX\). Hopefully, you will find your device and the measurement data on the screen then!**
